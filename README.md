# tutor_management_system
Data Structure Assignment Project (Group)

  eXcel Tuition Centre is one of the fastest growing tuition centres in Malaysia. The current system that they are using now could not manage the growth of the data and functions. The current system is also hard to manage the tutors and searching the tutor ID or name is complicated. Therefore, a new system is needed to manage the tutor and the centres.

  The new system can benefit the tutor centre in ways such as, simplify search function, simple tutor managing function, and simplify sorting functions. A new system also benefits in time saving, efficiency and simplify GUI for admins to understand the system better. Therefore, this is a proposal for the development of a tutor management system. During this development our team has chooses 2 approaches to develop the system. The 2 approaches are Array of Structure and Linked List. Developing using the 2 approaches is to compare which approach is better at compiling and running the system. Our team has developed the both approaches to find out the strength and weaknesses. There has been countless obstacle in the development, however, despite the obstacles our team had still manage to develop the system because the outcome benefit is greater.
